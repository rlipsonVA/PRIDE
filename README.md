Glucocorticoids are used commonly despite their toxicity and the availability of effective alternatives. Prior claims-based studies evaluating the effect of clinician specialty on glucocorticoid prescribing predate COVID-19 and do not examine the effect of facility-level resources on prescribing patterns.
